4. Tim Hopper
Who is Tim Hopper?
Tim Hopper is a data scientist, machine learning engineer, and cybersecurity software developer based in the US.

What makes Tim Hopper’s data analytics portfolio so great?
Tim’s is a great example of a multimedia portfolio. Rather than bombarding us with a list of his past projects, he’s given us a taste of his interests and expertise using a variety of different methods. This includes a combination of humor, podcasts, articles, and videos that tell us what he does and show us how he works. The details of his projects, meanwhile, are available on his GitHub (which he links to in numerous places on his website).

On his homepage, Tim quickly grabs our attention with unobtrusive but bold visuals, and a headline that tells us his key skills: ‘Machine Learning. Cybersecurity. Python. Software Engineering. Math Jokes.’ This provides a nice taste of his experience, as well as his personality. Notice that the top menu includes links to Tim’s podcasts, talks, and articles, as well as other sites of interest. He also links out to his social media: Twitter, LinkedIn, and GitHub. These offer more in-depth information about his professional background.

Interestingly, Tim doesn’t use his portfolio to discuss specific projects. This is an admittedly bold move. Instead, he sells himself as a thought leader and influencer, writing about his experiences and sharing talks and podcasts about his time as a data scientist. This is a high-risk but high pay-off strategy, and Tim executes it well. While this approach is better suited to more experienced data scientists, that doesn’t mean we can’t learn from it. Using articles, videos, and podcasts gives him a legitimate excuse to enrich his portfolio with additional media. His website is also laden with personality. He has a sense of humor, which is an appealing quality in itself.

What can we learn from Tim Hopper?
Tim shows us that you don’t need a traditional portfolio to make an impact. By creating a distinctive personal brand, you can boost your profile with more than just sample projects. By including his articles, videos, and podcasts, Tim has given us direct proof that he is a competent communicator and data scientist. If we want to find out more, we can contact him via his numerous social media platforms.

Key takeaway
Think about the different ways you can spice up your portfolio. While we always recommend including sample projects (which Tim hasn’t done) you can definitely still enhance your offering by evidencing your other interests. Create a unique offering that nobody else can compete with.
